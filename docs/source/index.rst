glint is a user-friendly command line tool for fast analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data generated using the Illumina human methylation arrays. glint allows to easily run a pipeline of Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) under different models while accounting for known confounders in methylation data.
